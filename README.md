## What's Here
- [`figures/`](figures/) - Contains figures used in the paper.
  - `accuracy_statistics_logP/` - Overall accuracy assessment for all methods participating in the SAMPL7 logP challenge in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format. Both root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are shown, with error bars denoting 95% confidence intervals.
  - `correlation_plots_well_performing_methods_logP/` - Predicted vs. experimental value correlation plots of 5 best performing methods and one representative average method in the SAMPL7 logP challenge. Dark and light green shaded areas indicate 0.5 and 1.0 units of error. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean of predicted and experimental values. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `molecule_prediction_accuracy_logP-classes-marked/` - Molecule-wise prediction accuracy in the logP challenge. Molecules are labeled with their compound class as a reference. (A) shows the MAE calculated for each molecule as an average of all methods. (B) shows the MAE of each molecule separated by method category. (C) shows logP prediction error distribution for each molecule across all prediction methods. (D) shows logP prediction error distribution for each molecule calculated for only 5 methods from blind ranked submissions that were determined to be consistently well-performing. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `relative-free-energy-network-example/` - For each molecule in the SAMPL7 pKa challenge we asked participants to predict the relative free energy between our selected neutral reference microstate and the rest of the enumerated microstates for that molecule. This figure gives an example of this using challenge molecule SM43 as an example-- participants were asked to predict the relative free energy between SM43\_micro000 (our selected neutral microstate highlighted in yellow) and all of the other enumerated microstates. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `titration-graph/` - Graph that corresponds to the titration method in the paper. Blue and orange lines represent two states. Blue states have one more proton than the orange states, and thus a formal charge higher by +1. The blue state has one tautomer and the orange state has 3, denoted by the dashed lines. The solid lines are the ensemble averaged state probability for each group with a given charge. The crossing point between two ensemble lines is the macroscopic pKa. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `accuracy-statistics-pKa/` - Overall accuracy assessment for all methods participating in the SAMPL7 pKa challenge. Both RMSE and MAE are shown, with error bars denoting 95% confidence intervals. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `correlation-plots-well-performing-methods-pKa/` - Predicted vs. experimental value correlation plots of the two best performing methods and one representative average method in the SAMPL7 pKa challenge. Dark and light green shaded areas indicate 0.5 and 1.0 units of error. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean of predicted and experimental values. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `correlation-statistics-pKa/` - Overall correlation assessment for all methods participating in the SAMPL7 pKa challenge. Pearson’s R^2 and Kendall’s Rank Correlation Coefficient Tau are shown, with error bars denoting 95% confidence intervals. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `molecule_prediction_accuracy_pKa-classes-marked/` - Molecule-wise prediction error distribution plots show the prediction accuracy for individual molecules across all prediction methods for the pKa challenge. Molecules are labeled with their compound class as a reference.
  (A) shows the MAE calculated for each molecule as an average of all methods. (B) shows the MAE of each molecule separated by method category suggests the most challenging molecules were different for each method category. (C) shows error distribution for each molecule over all prediction methods. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `difficult-transitions-2d-depictions/` - Figure shows some chemical transformations that repeatedly show up as having large disagreement on the sign of the relative free energy prediction. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `microstate_averages_and_distribution-classes-marked/` - The average relative microstate free energy predicted per microstate and the distribution across predictions in the SAMPL7 pKa challenge. Molecules are labeled with their compound class as a reference. (A) shows the average relative microstate free energy predicted per microstate. Error bars are the standard deviation of the relative microstate free energy predictions. (B) shows the distribution for each relative microstate free energy prediction over all prediction methods. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `micro-disagreement/` - Structures of microstates where relative microstate free energy predictions disagree. The average relative free energy prediction along with the standard deviation are listed under each transition. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
  - `Shannon_entropy_pos_neg_only/` - Shows the Shannon entropy (H) per microstate transition. Microstates with entropy values greater than 0 reflect increasing disagreement in the predicted sign. Microstates with an entropy of 0 are not shown here, but indicate that methods made predictions which had the same sign for the free energy change associated with a particular transition. Figure is available in `.PDF` and `.SVG` file format.
